# Lumberjack
A framework for making WordPress theme development more sane & easier to maintain.

The framework has been designed to be as un-intrusive as possible and you're free to use as little or as much of it as you'd like.

Written & maintained by the team at [Rareloop](https://www.rareloop.com).
